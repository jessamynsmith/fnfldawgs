<h2>Rules for Fantasy Football</h2>
<p>Each team will consist of the following position players:</p>
<ul> 
    <li>(1) QB</li>
    <li>(2) RB’s</li>
    <li>(2) WR’s</li>
    <li>(1) TE</li>
    <li>(1) K</li>
</ul>
 
<p>There are no backup players.  If a player in your lineup gets hurt, too bad.</p>
 
<p>Each player must play his normal position as determined by NFL.com team sites depth charts.</p>
 
<p>You can use any NFL player you want to within the following restrictions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>You cannot use the same player in two consecutive weeks.  The lone exception to this rule is the last week of the regular season, Week 17, and the playoffs, Week 18.</li>
    <li>You cannot use the same player more than 4 times in the entire season, including the playoffs.</li>
    <li>If an ineligible player is used, the team is charged with the usage of the player, but the team will not receive any points scored by the ineligible player.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lineups should indicate the players name and team for clarification purposes.  If a lineup contains a player with a duplicate first name or initial and no team is designated for clarification, the player will receive the points generated by the LOWEST of the named players.  Examples of this are wide receivers listed as M. Floyd (either Malcom or Michael) or J. Jones (either James, Julio, or Jacoby).</p>

<p>Lineups are to be submitted no later than 1 hour prior to the scheduled TV time of the first game for the week.  For weeks with Sunday only games, scheduled TV time is normally 1:00PM Eastern, 12:00 noon Central time.  For weeks with a Thursday game, your entire lineup must be submitted by Thursday, 1 hour prior to the scheduled TV time, ONLY if you choose to include any player(s) from the Thursday game in your lineup.  If you do not play anyone from the Thursday game, your lineup will not be due until 1 hour prior to the scheduled kickoff of the Sunday games, or Saturday whichever is applicable. You may make changes to your lineups after the original submission, but whatever the last submission is before the final cutoff time, is what you get.  Whenever possible, I will send out an email to post that the entry time has passed and no additional or modified entries will be accepted.</p>

<p>If a team does not submit a lineup for whatever reason for a given week, they will be assigned the lineup used 2 weeks prior.  In other words, if a team, does not put in a lineup for Week 6, they would be assigned the same lineup used in Week 4.  Failure to put a lineup in for Week’s 1 or 2 will result in zero points.</p>

<p>Scoring rules and points awarded are as follows.  All scoring statistics will be taken from the NFL.com website for game statistics.</p>

<ul> 
    <li>Touchdown = 6 pts. Points awarded to the rusher.  If a passing TD, both the thrower (usually the QB) and the receiver each get 6 pts.</li>
    <li>Return TD’s = 6pts. Points awarded for kickoff, punt returns, fumble returns, interception returns, blocked field goal returns, but only if the player scoring is in your lineup.</li>
    <li>Field Goal = 3 pts. – awarded to the kicker.</li>
    <li>Kicked Extra Point = 1 pt. – awarded to the kicker.</li>
    <li>2Pt. Conversions = 2 pts. Points awarded to rusher.  If passed, both the passer and the receiver get 2 pts each.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>Yardage points awarded as follows:</p>

<ul>
    <li>300 yards passing = 6 pts.  Add 3 pts for each 50 yards thereafter.</li>
    <li>100 yards rushing = 6 pts.  Add 3 pts for each 50 yards thereafter.</li>
    <li>100 yards receiving = 6 pts.  Add 3 pts for each 50 yards thereafter.</li>
    <li>Tight End Receiving Points:  Each 50 yards receiving = 3 pts.  No bonus points.</li>
    <li>Running Back Receiving Points:  Each 50 yards receiving = 3 pts.  No bonus points.</li>
    <li>No yardage points are awarded for return yardage.</li>
</ul>

<p>Point Deductions:</p>

<ul>
    <li>We will deduct 2 pts from the QB, or any other player, for each interception thrown.</li>
</ul>
 
<p>The schedule consists of 17 weeks to the regular season.  The end of the season playoffs, Week 18, consists of all the games from the Wild Card games through the Super Bowl.</p>
 
<p>After the Monday night game(s) of each week, the points are totaled for each team.  These are considered “raw” points.  The team with the highest raw point total takes first place for the week, second highest is next, etc, etc.</p>
 
<p>The standings are cumulative over the season and consist of quality points.  In a 20 team league, the weekly high point team would receive 20 quality points, second would get 19, etc.  The lowest scoring team would thus get 1 point.</p>
